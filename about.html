            Almost everyone, who is interested to know Bhutan better is aware with the fact that Bhutan is guided by the
            development philosophy of Gross National Happiness (GNH), instead of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
            Therefore, GNH being one of its primary development principles, High Value-Low Volume is the outstanding
            feature of Bhutan's Tourism Policy which puts Bhutan as one of the top high end tourist destination in the
            world. Bhutan has three different ecological/ climatic zones. They are; Sub-tropical in the south, Temperate
            in the central and Sub-alpine to the north. This clearly indicates that Bhutan has extreme weather
            conditions if taken in totality from North to South. These varied climatic zones make a chilling and snowy
            winter in the North and a pleasant dry winter in the south. The weather conditions in the central region of
            Bhutan remain reasonably moderate throughout the four seasons. Monsoon in Bhutan are with heavy torrential
            rain in Southern region and mild on and off rainfalls in the Central upward North. The typical monsoon
            starts from June and will go till the end of August with some rainfall even during the month of September in
            the southern foothills. Therefore, the suitable time to visit Bhutan for getting maximum benefit from this
            pristine land is encouraged during the month of March to May and September to November.

        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="para">
            The pre-historic era of Bhutan dates back to 600 to 700 AD. Only after the 17th Century, the country called
            Bhutan came into birth and to be called as Drukyul of The Land of Thunder Dragon. This name is derived from
            the Drukpa Kargyu School, one of the sub-sects of Vajrayana Buddhism. Until 1961, Bhutan remained isolated
            from outside world in terms of modern development and it was only in this year that the third King of Bhutan
            Late Jigme Dorji Wangchuck ended the isolation and launched Bhutan forward on the path of modern development
            by introducing the first Five Year Plan in Bhutan. Thereafter, Bhutan's pace of modernization in terms of
            Education, Health, Tourism, Agriculture, renewable natural resources etc has been commendable and is been
            applauded by development partners even by mentioning Bhutan as a great example. Without much compromising on
            its pristine environment, Bhutan, on today's date is the only country in the world with carbon negative. For
            this, the unwavering gratefulness and thankfulness from the citizens of Bhutan goes to our forth Druk
            Gyalpo, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck for incepting his farsightedness policy of maintaining 70% of the total
            land as forest cover at all times.

            With the first Five Year Plan 1961-66, Bhutan gained enormous experience in taking the country further as an
            independent self-reliant nation. In this process, the third king (then reigning king) with his far-sighted
            vision exposed the country with some of the oldest and the most important UN Organizations by officially
            becoming the member of those Organizations. Below mentioned are some of the most popular UN Organizations

            Tourism plays a vital role in tapping the major revenue generation to the government account. It was first
            introduction to the country dates back to 1974 when Bhutan received a total number of 287 Tourists that
            year. After a decade and a half time, government thought it wise to privatize it and today Tourism is one of
            the major government revenue generators besides hydropower, cottage industries. Agriculture is the major
            source of livelihood for almost 60% of the total population. Although, a small developing country in the
            south east Asian region, Bhutan now is considered as one of the fastest growing countries in the world. Its
            average annual economic growth rate stands at 7.5%.

            <br>

            Environment: Bhutan is committed in its policy of preservation and protection of its rich pristine
            environment. In consideration to its size and geographical location, it is one of the very few South East
            Asian Countries which has the greatest bio-diversity in the Continent. Our fourth King, His Majesty King
            Jigme Singye Wangchuck's vision of maintaining at least 60% of the total land as forest reserve can be still
            seen even today. Some of this forest territory is maintained as national parks, reserves and protected
            areas. The Forest and Nature Conservation Act enacted in 1995 plays a vital role in maintaining and
            protecting the country's forest and wildlife.
